The debug prints are not showing in telnet because:

The networking->loop() function is never called in the main loop of openThermSlave_Demo.cpp.

This loop() function is required to:
1. Handle new telnet connections
2. Check for disconnected clients
3. Keep the telnet connection alive

To fix, add this line in the main loop():
networking->loop();

Right after:
ot.process();
