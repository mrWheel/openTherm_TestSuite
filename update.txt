Partition Table Analysis:

1. Memory Alignment Issue:
- Partition 'otadata' starts at 0xe000 which is not 4KB aligned
- Partition 'coredump' starts at 0x10000 which is correctly aligned
- Partition 'phy_init' starts at 0x11000 which is not 4KB aligned

2. Size Issues:
- nvs partition (0x5000 = 20KB) is small for storing WiFi credentials and other data
- coredump partition (0x1000 = 4KB) is too small for meaningful crash dumps
- phy_init (0x1000 = 4KB) is smaller than recommended

3. OTA Partitions:
- app0 and app1 are equal size (0x300000 = 3MB) which is correct
- Total app space is 6MB

4. SPIFFS:
- spiffs size is 0x1D0000 (1.8MB)
- Ends at 0x7F0000, leaving unused space
